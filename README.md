## Description

I have Also made it Light and Dark Theme prefered compatible and with the reset it should accomidate for people with the prefered motion reduced.

Here I have made a simple employee portfolio that one might see hiring for or looking through probable candidates when hiring a web developer.

This has given me a good oversight of how a site should be structrured and organized so that you and other people can come back to it and understand it completely.
